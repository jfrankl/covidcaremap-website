why-heading: Why this matters
why-description: >-
  <p>Something about flattening the curve AND how our efforts can support the work being done towards this effort. Our health system capacity is at risk of being overwhelmed.</p><p>ICUs typically operate at around 70% occupancy, which means critically ill COVID patients (or non-COVID patients who need it) may not get ICU level of care due to lack of available beds or staffing or equipment.</p>
