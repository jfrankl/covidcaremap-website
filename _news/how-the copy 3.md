He's at a city rec center, where the left-wing group Reclaim Philadelphia is meeting, on a muggy June night ... Through the evening, young leader after young leader of Reclaim Philadelphia shares the experiences that have fueled their political activism. A man tells the crowd his mother was arrested on Christmas Eve for driving a car involved in a robbery, and why that inspires his fight for criminal justice reform. A woman talks about being raped in college, and how that powers her work against sexual violence.

Reclaim Philadelphia has been a major force behind the left wing's biggest victories in the city in recent years.
