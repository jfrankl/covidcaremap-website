“Attorney General Shapiro, I want to say thank you for listening to what we have to say and for committing to support local Philadelphians in keeping our communities safe,” Reclaim Philadelphia organizer Rick Krajewski said, after Shapiro said he would support a repeal. “And we will be watching to make sure that you actually follow through on the commitments that you just made.” 

“This kind of dialogue is important,” Shapiro replied. “But let’s not lose sight of the fact that we have people dying in this city at an alarming rate,” he said. 

“We know,” protesters replied. “We live here.”
