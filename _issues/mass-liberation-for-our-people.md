title: Liberation for Our People
intro_paragraph: >-
  Philadelphia has become a national leader in criminal justice reform. With the
  election of Larry Krasner as District Attorney, the decarceration movement has
  pushed a transformation that’s led to our jail population being its lowest in
  20 years, along with a decrease in violent crime.

The system has been criminalizing poverty, profiling black and brown communities, and creating a feedback system that never lets go of people with a criminal record. We are finally undoing the harm caused by the “tough on crime” era of our past. This is a historic moment for our city and country, but there is more that must be done. We must continue to win big in the areas of sentencing reform, diversion programs, and holistics approaches to violence in our communities. As a state representative, I will fight for the liberation of all of our people, and ensure that no one is treated as a second-class citizen.

**I will:**

* Work to limit pre-trial holding to only the most serious offenses, and stand against the implementation of racially-biased risk assessment algorithms
* Push for probation and parole reform that caps sentencing for felonies and misdemeanors, eliminate technical violations on the basis of inability to pay fines and fees, severely limit the use of electronic monitoring as a form of supervision
* Fight for sentencing reform that revises the Pennsylvania Sentencing Code, abolishing mandatory minimums, the death penalty, and life without parole
* Address gun violence through a combination of gun reform legislation and community-based solutions that respect survivors and our neighborhoods
