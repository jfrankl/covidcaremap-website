title: We were frustrated by confusing political districts, so we started MapBlue
heading: About
permalink: /about
intro: While volunteering for a state house candidate, we noticed that one of the first questions we would receive from potential voters was “am I inside the district?” Some of our neighbors were in the district, and others, who lived four blocks away or even across the street, were not.

employee2-name: Matt Frankl
employee2-bio: Matt is a warehouse inventory coordinator/musician who became more involved in politics during the run-up to the 2016 election (better late than never, right?).  He is responsible for MapBlue‘s business development and customer service.

<p>We made a map for our own reference and soon it was added to the <a href="https://rickforwestphilly.com/">candidate’s website</a>. The map was the perfect answer to this common question about district boundaries. But when we looked at other campaign websites, we discovered that most didn’t have a map. Or if they had a map, it was a screenshot from a PDF, or it was difficult to read on a phone. We saw an opportunity to support other progressive political campaigns with this same kind of service.</p>
